# IT634_Wk7_Auth
IT-634 User Authentication

# Overview
In this activity, you will develop a RESTful web service for user authentication and registration.

# Prompt
Create a RESTful web service to authenticate users with their username and password. It should also allow users to register a new account. For this activity, you should be using a local XML file for storing user information. Write code to perform the following tasks:

Write a RESTful web service that accepts user credentials, checks the local XML file to see if the user is valid, and returns status.
Enhance the RESTful web service to allow user registrations. The API should accept user information, persist the information to the local XML file, and return the status.

Note: The local file should be XML only.
The following critical elements must be addressed:

Functional Code: Ensure that the code for your application is functional, efficient, and bug free.
Adherence to Specifications: Run and debug code to ensure it does not contain any errors.
Efficiency of Code and Annotations: Write in-code comments that evidence good programming practice.
